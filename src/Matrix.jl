        #     # off diagonal elements are reduced to values so small they are beyond the range of whatever precision float you are using. This is probably necessary if want high relative accuracy in small singular values but
        #     # there are many cases when this is not a requirement.
        #     # Have to use eps(T) instead of a test for equality because C# is apparently not using 64 bit IEEE double precision arithmetic. Instead it appears to be using the Intel extended precision 
        #     # floating point. It takes many more iterations to reduce the diagonal elements to zero in this precision than in double precision.
        #     # an even more stringent requirement would be for the off diagonal elements also not to be changed by the rotation matrix but this can increase the number of iterations by 3-5 times for small 
        #     # matrices, maybe more for big matrices. In some extreme cases exiting before the off diagonal elements cease to be changed may result in more error in the singular vectors than desirable but I have not observed this yet.
