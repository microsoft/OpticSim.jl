# Roadmap

Opticks.jl is still under active development. Here are things we are considering:

## User Interface

- Improvements to visualization tools
  - Better control of 3D/2D system views
  - More drawing options (e.g. wireframe)
  - More analysis tools e.g. grids of spot diagrams, OPD diagrams etc.
- Interactive editor, probably in a spreadsheet format or similar
- Easily usable optimization features

## Optimization

- Performance improvements
- More rigorous local optimization (better parameter limits)
- Global optimization/smart initialization
- Better interface (particularly for merit function design)

## Raytracing

- Improvements to ray energy accuracy
- Improve HOE implementations
- Finish implementation of Bezier and BSpline surfaces (mostly done)

## Other

- Properly support Julia 1.6 once released
- Add automatic 'run on azure' options
- Some long standing bug fixes/improvements to implementations

## Long-Term

- Simulation of gradient index (GRIN) materials
- Simulation of meta-materials
- CSG file import/export
- Simulate physical effects of thermal variation (physical expansion)
- Support polarization of rays and elements relying on this
