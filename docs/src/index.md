# OpticSim.jl

OpticSim.jl is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package for simulation and optimization of complex optical systems developed by the Microsoft Research Interactive Media Group and the Microsoft HART group.

It is designed to allow optical engineers to create optical systems procedurally and then to simulate and optimize them. Unlike Zemax, Code V, or other interactive optical design systems OpticSim.jl has limited support for interactivity, primarily in the tools for visualizing optical systems.

A large variety of surface types are supported, and these can be composed into complex 3D objects through the use of constructive solid geometry (CSG). A complete catalog of optical materials is provided through the complementary GlassCat submodule.

This software provides extensive control over the modelling, simulation, visualization and optimization of optical systems. It is especially suited for designs that have a procedural architecture.


## Installation

Install the Julia programming language from the [official download page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
OpticSim.jl is optimized for use with Julia 1.5.2-1.6.0, using other versions may result in reduced performance.

Before you can use OpticSim.jl you must acquire glass files. These files are in an industry standard format and can be downloaded from many optical glass manufacturers. Create an environment variable GLASS_CAT_DIR that points to the directory where you have copied the glass files. 

The system will automatically download files from some manufacturers (currently just NIKON,OHARA,HOYA,SCHOTT) when the package is built for the first time. The other glass files must be downloaded manually and placed in your GLASS_CAT_DIR folder.

Here are links to several publicly available glass files:
*   [NIKON](https://www.nikon.com/products/optical-glass/assets/pdf/nikon_zemax_data.zip) (automatically downloaded)
*   [NHG](http://hbnhg.com/down/data/nhgagp.zip) (you have to manually download)
*   [OHARA](https://www.oharacorp.com/xls/OHARA_201130_CATALOG.zip) (automatically downloaded)
*   [HOYA](https://hoyaoptics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HOYA20170401.zip) (automatically downloaded)
*   [SUMITA](https://www.sumita-opt.co.jp/en/download/) (you have to manually download)
*   [SCHOTT](https://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/download/index.html) (you have to manually download)

For the examples to work properly you must rename the Schott, Nikon, Ohara, and Hoya .agf files to SCHOTT.agf, NIKON.agf, OHARA.agf, HOYA.agf. The agf file standard doesn't require the glass catalog name to be included in the file so our code uses the name of the .agf file as the catalog name.

When you first use the OpticSim package the system will generate a glass database from all the glasses in the GLASS_CAT_DIR and store them in the file AGFClassCat.jl. If you add new glass files to GLASS_CAT_DIR delete the AGFGlassCat.jl and the system will rebuild the database.

Run this example to check that everything installed properly:

```@example
using OpticSim
Vis.draw(SphericalLens(OpticSim.GlassCat.SCHOTT.N_BK7, 0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 5.0, 5.0))
Vis.save("assets/test_install.png") # hide
nothing # hide
```

### System Image

We recommend compiling a custom [Julia system image](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/sysimages) for the OpticSim.jl package to reduce startup time and improve first-time performance.
If you are using VSCode as your IDE you can create a sysimage by opening the commant palette (CTRL-shift-P), Tasks: Run Build Task, julia: Build custom sysimage for current environment.

If you are not using VSCode we have create a julia script file that will build the sysimage. To create the system image simply run:

```bash
julia --project=[your_project] -e "using OpticSim.Sysimage; Sysimage.compile()"
```

By default the sysimage is located in the current working directory. On linux OS'es it will be called `JuliaSysimage.so`, and on the Windows OS the extension will be `.dll`. A custom path can be used instead which is passed as an argument to `compile()`.

To use the generated system image in the future, run Julia with the `--sysimage` flag:

```bash
julia --project=[your_project] --sysimage=[path_to_sysimage]
```

If OpticSim.jl is installed in the base project then there is no need for the `--project` flag in the above commands.
