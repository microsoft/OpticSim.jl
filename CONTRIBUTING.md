## Contributing to OpticSim.jl

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, it's great to see you here!

Our aim is to be as collaborator-friendly as possible, but we're a small team so please bear with us while we get set up. This project started out as an in-house tool for specific optical simulations, but we'd like to see it growing into a modern replacement for general optical engineering tasks.

WIP:
- Bug reports
- Contributing guidelines
- Code style
- Branch naming conventions
- Forking workflow
- Development roadmap
